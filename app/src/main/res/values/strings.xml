    <string name="story_the_lost_key">It was a rainy Sunday afternoon, and Oliver was bored. He lived in a large, old house that had belonged to his grandfather. The house was full of secrets, but there was one room Oliver had never entered: the attic. The door was always locked, and nobody seemed to know where the key was. His mother said it had been lost for years.\\n\\n\n    Determined to solve the mystery, Oliver decided to search the entire house. He started in the library, checking inside every dusty book. He looked behind the heavy curtains in the living room and even crawled under the dining table. He found a lot of things—an old coin, a marble, and a missing sock—but no key.\\n\\n\n    Hours passed, and the rain continued to tap against the windows. Oliver felt tired and disappointed. He went into the kitchen to get a glass of water. As he sat down on a wooden chair near the window, he noticed something strange about the flower pot on the windowsill. It had a small crack on the side.\\n\\n\n    He looked closer and saw a glint of metal inside the crack. His heart began to beat faster. He carefully lifted the flower pot and shook it gently. Clink! A small, rusty object fell onto the table. It was an old-fashioned iron key with a unique design on the handle.\\n\\n\n    Oliver grabbed the key and ran up the stairs, two at a time. He reached the attic door, his hand trembling slightly. He inserted the key into the lock. It was a tight fit, but with a little force, it turned with a loud click. The door creaked open, revealing a room filled with old trunks and paintings. The mystery of the attic was finally solved.</string>
